# NegSpace

Thank you for taking a look at my project. NegSpace is a DOOM wad dedicated to exploring the used of negative space and light. We are dependent on our sense of sight to see things we recognize, but imagine if this were taken away from you in a way that one may not expect. Your sight still works, but you have to adapt because it does not function the way you are accustomed to.

This is inspired in large part by DOOM 3, which is an underrated classic. The work done with shadows and lighting were nothing short of astonishing. However, the game itself did not fully gel as a cohesive whole. I want to take another look at some of those ideas in a back-to-basics kind of way. What better way of doing that than with DOOM 93?
